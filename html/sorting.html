	<h3>How do Venn Diagrams work? Try out the following exercise</h3>
	<h5>(Instructions: Drag all the objects which belong to the selected rule in the drop-down menu. You can make the game complicated 
	by using two circles/sets having an intersection or not. 
	Also there is an option to either make the rule (which is the default) or guess the rule by clicking on the buttons given on left.)</h5>

	<b><i>Venn Diagrams</i></b> were first developed by John Venn in the 1880s. They are useful for illustrating the relationships between sets.<br>
	Each set is illustrated by a circle. When two circles overlap, this shows an intersection of the two sets.<br>
	In this activity, each of the properties of given objects are named like circles, red, etc. If we consider the Venn diagram with two sets
	and an intersection between them, then let each property be a variable, for example <br>
		<b> A = Red <br> B = Circle <br></b>
	There are four areas in the Venn Diagram, one which will contain only the objects which are red, one with only circles, the central area that has 
	objects which are both red and circles, and everything which is not red, circle or both belongs to the universal set.
	<br>
	Each of these four possibilities are denoted by an individual row in the truth table of 2 variables.
	So, each area of the Venn Diagram and each row of the truth table is called a <u><b><i>"Valuation"/"Interpretation"</i></b></u>. 
	The valuation holds true only in its corresponding area of the Venn Diagram.
